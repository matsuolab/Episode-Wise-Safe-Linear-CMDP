# Official Implementations of "Provably Efficient RL under Episode-Wise Safety in Constrained MDPs with Linear Function Approximation" 

* See the implementation in [Experiment.ipynb](Experiment.ipynb).


## Requirements

```bash
uv sync
```

## Run Experiments and Plot the results

Run all the cells in [Experiment.ipynb](Experiment.ipynb).
The results will be saved as "results-random.pdf" for the synthetic env and "results-streaming.pdf" for the streaming env.
